# Editable TEXT recovery checkpoint

## Current commit

`625dcd9 test: record editable-text UAT failure evidence`

Branch: `fix/non-destructive-editable-text`

Phase 12 baseline:
`baseline/phase12-final-acceptance-2026-07-30` ->
`6f5f69329aabf0bd3a7eda84baf66eb1959bdcba`

## Completed

- Verified the phase 12 tag still points to the original phase 12 commit.
- Created the dedicated repair branch from the current repository HEAD.
- Committed only `validation/uat-page001-failure/`.
- Preserved existing `tmp/` content without modification or staging.
- Recorded the product and implementation contract in this directory.
- Captured the complete pre-change unit-test result: 259 passed, 0 failed.
- Re-ran the formal text-contract set: 10/10 unique real pages passed.
- Audited all 10 newly generated formal-set DXFs.
- Audited all 14 existing user-PDF DXFs without modifying them.
- Recorded per-DXF TEXT, fallback-outline, text-symbol, residual and audit
  counts.

## Not completed

- Editable TEXT emission and outline-suppression decoupling.
- Hidden unsafe source-glyph backup layer.
- Candidate-level semantic ownership.
- Native TEXT geometry fitting.
- Full per-page and per-DXF acceptance.

## Modified files

- Validation evidence and the read-only DXF inventory helper under
  `validation/editable-text-recovery/`.

No production code has been modified.

## Tests

- `python -m pytest -q`: 259 passed, 141 warnings, 17.41 seconds.
- Formal text-contract validation: 10/10 documents passed.
- Formal generated-DXF audit: 10/10 passed.
- Existing user-PDF DXF audit: 14/14 passed.

## Per-page status

See:

- `before/text-contract.json`
- `before/formal-dxf-inventory.json`
- `before/user-pdf-dxf-inventory.json`

The 240 DPI fixed failure page remains:

- OCR candidates: 208
- native TEXT: 37
- fallback candidates: 169
- residual candidates: 2
- `TRACE_TEXT_SYMBOL` entities: 1406
- DXF audit errors: 0

## Next single safe action

Audit the production text-output decision and export call chains for every
place where `replacement_safe` can prevent native TEXT emission. Do not modify
source-outline routing yet.
